What you need to run or use it: You need python installed on your computer.
If you do not have pthon install, you google how to install python of
you can go to one of my favorit websites which easy to follow instructions.
for Windows http://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/
for Mac http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/

You will also need 3 program files (enterainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py,
media.py)

You can download the 3 files from my github page:
https://github.com/mcbob98/movie

To run the program open a command prompt for windows of a terminal for mac
and navigate to where you downloaded the 3 files to. Once you at the directory
where you downloaded the files type "python enterainment.py" the browser should
launch with three of my favorit movies. To watch a trailer of one the movies 
just click one of the poster images.
